react.creatElement returns an object. when we render the element to the dom then it become HTML element.
ReactDom helps to convert the react element to HTML element

JSX is a JS syntax to create react elements, It is not an HTML in Javascript. its a html or xml like syntax
JSX IS transpiled before it reaches to the js engine and its transpiling is done by the babel. 
JSX attributes has to be camelcase
Multiple line jsx is needed to wrap between round brackets, That is how babel understands starting and the ending of the element
JSX=>Babel transpiles it to react.createelement => ReactElement-Js-Object => HTMLElement(render)
